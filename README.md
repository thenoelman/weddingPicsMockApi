# weddingPicsMockApi

instructions:

1) Open a terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows)
2) git clone https://github.com/thenoelman/weddingPicsMockApi.git
3) cd weddingPicsMockApi
4) npm install
5) "nodemon index.js" or "node index.js" if you don't have nodemon installed
6) navigate a browser (Chrome or Firefox preferred) to localhost:3333/<insert name of route that you want to view>
7) I also recommend that you install the Moesif CORS plugin to Chrome or Firefox on your machine (and turn it on).  This will prevent your computer from thinking a cross-site scripting attack is occurring when you make http calls from React to your locally running mock API.
